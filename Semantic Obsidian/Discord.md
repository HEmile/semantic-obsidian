For 2021, it seemed like a cool idea to start a [Discord](https://discord.com/) server for [[Semantic Obsidian]]. You can join the server with [this link](https://discord.gg/sAmSGpaPgM).

Current goals of the server:
- Discussing the [[Neo4j Graph View Plugin]]
	- Help with installation
	- Showing off graphs
	- Discussing advanced use
		- Styling of the graph
		- Cypher querying
		- [[Neo4j graph visualizations]]
	- Feature requests and discussion
- Discuss ideas related to [[Semantic Obsidian]]
	- [[Obsidian]] plugin ideas
	- [[Link Types]] formalizations
	- Provide a space to collaborate on plugins
