Another use case for the [[Neo4j Graph View Plugin]] is to use your Obsidian vault in one of the many apps in the [[Neo4j Desktop]]
Graph Apps Store. Using with this plugin active will automatically connect it to your vault. Here are some suggestions:
### Neo4j Bloom
[Neo4j bloom](https://neo4j.com/product/bloom/) is very powerful graph visualization software. Compared to the embedded
graph view in Obsidian, it offers much more freedom in customization.

### GraphXR
[GraphXR](https://www.kineviz.com/) is a 3D graph view, which looks quite gorgeous!

### Neo4j Browser
A query browser that uses the Cypher language to query your vault. Can be used for advanced queries or data anlysis of
your vault.
